# snabbdom-template

Content insertion is accomplished by targeting standard HTML tag names and other CSS selectors.
Works with [snabbdom](https://github.com/paldepind/snabbdom).

This module allows you to develop plain HTML/CSS templates with dummy data in the places dynamic
data will be inserted. The benefit is that the templates can be developed independently from the
programming that dynamically incorporates data into the web page.
